# Tic Tac Toe
A simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses ❌ "X" and the other uses ⭕ "O." The objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns placing their symbols in empty squares until one player wins or the grid is full, resulting in a draw. It's a fun way to practice strategy and foresight!
